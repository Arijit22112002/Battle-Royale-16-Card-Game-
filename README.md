• King = 13   

• Queen = 12   

• Jack = 11


### 📜 Gameplay Rules:

• You select one card per round.

• The computer plays automatically.

• Higher value wins the round.

• Suit hierarchy breaks ties.

• The winner takes both cards.

### 🏆 Win the Game:

## About the Project:-


1] I have created a Battle Royale 16 Card Game (Human vs A.I.) Mobile Application for Android OS.


### 2] User Requirements:


• Android smartphone with Android 7.0 or later (Nougat or later).

• Minimum 2GB RAM for smooth operation.

• Ability to tap/select from a list of cards during each round.

• Responsive display to visualize game state transitions.

•Internet connectivity is not required; it works completely offline.

• Clear text display of scores and round numbers.

• Access to basic navigation options like Start, Next, and Exit.

• Basic familiarity with face cards and suit rankings for gameplay understanding.


### 3] Proposed System:


i} The system is a mobile app developed using Android Studio.

ii} It will feature a unique 16-card deck, precisely as defined, comprising four suits with four specific face cards each. 

iii} A core component will be the integrated AI opponent, allowing a human player to engage in competitive gameplay. 

iv} The system will fully automate card dealing, turn management, round comparison, and final score calculation.

v} A user-friendly graphical interface will be designed to display cards, scores, and game progression. 

vi} The game will enforce the defined hierarchy of suits (Spade > Heart > Club > Diamond) and face cards (Ace > King > Queen > Jack). 

vii} Card values will be numerically assigned (Ace=14, King=13, Queen=12, Jack=11) for computational comparison logic. 

viii} The system will ensure an 8-turn game structure, culminating in a clear declaration of the winner based on collected cards.

ix} Cards are shuffled and dealt randomly to the user and the computer.

x} The user manually selects cards, while the AI selects cards automatically.

xi} A round-by-round comparison is made using defined face and suit hierarchies.

xii} Cards are revealed visually, and the round winner is declared instantly.

xiii} Scoreboard updates after each round, keeping users engaged.

xiv} The final result screen displays total scores and announces the game winner.


### 4] Operating Environment – Hardware and Software


Hardware:

i} An Android phone or emulator with a minimum of 2GB of RAM.

ii} Touch screen for card selection and navigation.

iii} Screen resolution of 720x1280 or above recommended.

iv} Minimum storage space of 50MB for installation.

Software:

i} Android Studio for app development.

ii} Java 8 for game logic implementation.

iii} XML for user interface design.

iv} Android SDK and Gradle for building and packaging the app.
